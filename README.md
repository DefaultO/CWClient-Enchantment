# CWClient-Enchantment
Game: https://www.contractwarsgame.com/

Simple Hack with a Semi-Overlay that you can put on your second Screen. To have an advantage over your enemies.
Started coding it somewhere last year (2020). The other project, called [Vitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2QVE5G8S9Q)Hax, I lost, used GameOverlay.NET (that way you had it over your game, which was more user-friendly and didn't require a second screen) instead and had plenty more features.
