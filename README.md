# CWClient-Enchantment
Simple Hack with a Semi-Overlay that you can put on your second Screen. To have an advantage over your enemies.
Started coding it somewhere last year (2020). The other project, called [Vitty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2QVE5G8S9Q)Hax, I lost, used GameOverlay.NET instead and had plenty more features.
